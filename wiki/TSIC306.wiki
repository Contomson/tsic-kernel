An overview of the TSIC 306 temperature sensor.

= Introduction =

The TSIC 306 is a digital temperature sensor which has an accuracy of +/-0.3K, resolution of 0.1K, measurement range from -50°C to +150°C and sampling rate of 10Hz. It is available in a TO92 package with three wires (VCC, GND and DATA) and can be directly interfaced to GPIO pins on most microcontrollers. It communicates over a simple 1-wire interface.
